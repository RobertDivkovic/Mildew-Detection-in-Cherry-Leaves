# Mildew Detection in Cherry Leaves

## Project Overview

This project addresses a critical quality control issue for *Farmy & Foods*, a fictional agricultural company that specializes in cherry production. The company's cherry plantations are experiencing cases of **powdery mildew**, a fungal disease that affects the leaves and degrades product quality.

The current manual inspection process is slow, costly, and not scalable. This project aims to:
- **Visually differentiate** healthy and infected leaves.
- **Predict mildew presence** using image classification.
- **Deploy an interactive dashboard** for image upload and prediction.

By automating the detection process, *Farmy & Foods* can save inspection time, reduce operational costs, and protect its product quality.

## CRISP-DM Methodology

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Business Understanding** | Predict powdery mildew on cherry leaves from image data to reduce manual labor and improve quality control. |
| **Data Understanding** | Image dataset of healthy and infected cherry leaves (256x256 pixels). Class distribution and image quality evaluated. |
| **Data Preparation** | Images resized, normalized, and split into train/validation/test sets. Data augmentation used for generalization. |
| **Modeling** | CNN model trained using TensorFlow/Keras. Optimized via dropout, early stopping, and learning rate tuning. |
| **Evaluation** | Confusion matrix, accuracy, and learning curves. Success defined as â‰¥97% accuracy on test data. |
| **Deployment** | Streamlit dashboard built for end-user image prediction, hosted via Heroku. |

## Business Requirements

### Requirement 1: Visual Differentiation Study
- Show how healthy and infected leaves differ using:
  - **Average images**

  - **Montage of sample images**
- Use conventional EDA techniques to support analysis.

### Requirement 2: Predictive ML Model
- Build a neural network to classify cherry leaf images.
- Prediction output: Healthy or Powdery Mildew with confidence score.

### Requirement 3: Deployment
- Create an interactive dashboard for:
  - Uploading images
  - Viewing predictions and confidence
  - Downloading result tables
- Provide UI feedback on model performance and hypothesis validation.

- Model is intended for aiding professionals, not replacing expertise.

## Version Control

This project is version-controlled using **Git & GitHub**. Commit messages follow a clear format and branches are used to separate experimentation from stable code.



## Dataset Content

The dataset comprises **cherry leaf images** from real plantations, labeled as either **healthy** or infected with **powdery mildew**, a common fungal disease. These images are standardized at 256Ã—256 pixels and were collected by the IT & Innovation team at Farmy & Foods for the purpose of building a computer vision solution.

## Business Requirements

As a Data Analyst working on behalf of Farmy & Foods, your role is to provide insights and a deployable solution to streamline disease detection in cherry leaves. Currently, the company is facing challenges with timely identification of mildew in large-scale plantations.

* **Requirement 1:** The client seeks a visual study that helps differentiate healthy cherry leaves from those infected with powdery mildew.
* **Requirement 2:** The client wants an automated prediction tool that identifies whether a leaf is healthy or diseased from an uploaded image.

## Hypothesis and Validation

We hypothesize that:
- Cherry leaves affected by mildew present **distinct visual signs**, such as discoloration, texture changes, or fungal marks, which can be learned by a neural network.
- These differences can be revealed via average image studies, variability analysis, and class montages.

To validate:
- We will generate average and variability images.
- We will compare image statistics between healthy and mildew-infected classes.
- We will train and evaluate a deep learning model.

## Rationale: Business Requirements â†’ Visualizations & ML Tasks

### Business Requirement 1: Visual Differentiation Study
- Display **mean and standard deviation images** per class.
- Show the **difference between average healthy and infected images**.
- Present **image montages** for each class to illustrate sample diversity.

### Business Requirement 2: Image Classification
- Build a binary image classifier (CNN) to distinguish between classes.
- Provide **real-time predictions** via a Streamlit dashboard.
- Include **model performance evaluation** (confusion matrix, accuracy, confidence levels).
